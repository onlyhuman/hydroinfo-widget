hydroinfo-widget
================

A simple widget that shows information about hydrology data from [Hydro info ](http://www.hydroinfo.hu/)

__Work in progress__: the document and the project is just started...

#Idea&Goal
As an angler in Hungary it is always good to know hydology information about the river where I am fishing. 
We have two main rivers in Hungary: Duna and Tisza, but hydrology information is available for all cities next to these rivers (in other countries).
We anglers, are using [HYDRO INFO site](http://hydroinfo.hu) for this prupose but it is not enough convenient to provide the data of your location. 
So my idea was to create an Android widget where I can set my location(city) and river and get an update twice a day.
